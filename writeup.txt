Here are the answers to the two questions asked in the coding problems:


Problem 1:What would the bottleneck(s) be in your implementation as number of request/second increase?
How would you scale your microservice?

The bottleneck of the implementation is computing the sha256 hash. This is an O(n) operation (as you have to do operations on O(n) blocks). To scale, I would have try to do some load balancing [I'm not really sure]  

Problem 2: There may be many rows in the file, so be sure to optimize your solution to scale.
What is the big O notation for your program?

O(nlogn)
